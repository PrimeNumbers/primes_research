The file contains a list of my hypothesis that may or may not have been proven (or disproven) by others already.


1
For any multi-digit positive number in question, N, and the square root of said number, S.
If one were to attempt to divide N by every prime number up to and including the closest integer (rounded down) to S, it would prove that N is a prime number if there is no remainder.

It would be faster to have a program pre-find candidate prime numbers that can be checked later by sub programs.
For numbers greater than 5, any number whose last digit is: 0,2,4,5,6, or 8, the number cannot be prime.
Inversely for numbers greater than 5, a prime number's last digit can only be 1,3,7, or 9.
Eliminating the other 6 numbers would cut down the candidates to 40%.
Other quick tricks that eliminate candidates would be the divisible by 3 trick. (if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3 then the whole number is divisible by 3)
I have read about algorithms that can be done to quickly find if a number is divisible by other primes as well.
