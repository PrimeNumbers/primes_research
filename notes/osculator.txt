positive osculator
	in positive osculator you have to multiply the osculator with the last digit and add to the rest of numbers

negative osculator
	in negative osculator you have to multiply the osculator with the last digit and subtract to the rest of the numbers
	
	
	
	
positive osculator
	for numbers ending in 9
	9, 19, 29, 59, have (0+1=1), (1+1 = 2), (2+1=3), and (5+1=6) as osculator
	
	for numbers ending in 3
	we multiply the number by 3 so the last digit becomes 9 and then apply the above rule
	
	13, 23, 33 when multiplied by 3 gives 39, 69, 99 and their respective osculators are (3+1=4), (6+1=7), (9+1=10)
	


negative osculator
	for numbers ending in 1, simply drop the last digit and the number that is left is the osculator
	e.g. 21, 31, 41, 51   we have 2, 3, 4, 5, as negative osculator

	for numbers ending in 7, we multiply the number by 3 and so the last digit becomes 1 and then apply the above rule
	
	e.g.
	7, 17, 37, when multiplied by 3 give 21, 51, and 111, and their respective osculators are 2, 5, and 11
