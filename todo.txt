xfer_mover
	didn't finish making rules for each folder
	
state
	set_state incomplete
	missing test_state




I need to polish up the xfer mover to move files to the correct spot
	from candidate, to eval
	from eval, rename, move to next found
	from eval to remove
	from remove to removed
	


add to interface:
	this session has found X primes and eliminated Y candidates
	Most recent prime was ___ candidates ago.
						  (just found!)




Then flesh out the interface to be calling to the xfer mover functions

	interface should say, while search is set to true:
		start the xfer_mover sequence
